# PCSX2 Cheat Development Kit  
PCSX2 Menu Trainer Development Kit is a C++ library designed to simplify the process of creating cheats for the PCSX2 emulator. 
It aims to bridge the gap between modern cheat development practices and the classic era of cheat codes.
This framework provides tools to port older codes to a more modern approach, using additional libraries such as dear imgui and minhook.
